Ideas
========

Goal not to complaiin, but to build the best peer review system possible.

Prospositions:

1. Independent of manuscript depositions 
    - Pre- and Post- publication review possible 
    - Focus on one problem: peer review
    - No need of new manuscript in the system to start (all DOI objects are peer-reviewable directly)
    
2. We deal first with the ideal system, we will determine the way to go there later
    - We do not care about scientist's habit
    - We do not think about business models
    - We do not look at what exists

3. List of problems
    - Expensive
    - Slow
    - binary 
    - not verifiable because closed
    - biased (institution, gender,...)
    
4. Goal of peer review    
    - constructive to improve text/interpretation quality
    - check for appropriate methodology
    - check factual accuracy
    - correct spelling/grammar
    - set novelty and importance ?
    - detect fraud?
